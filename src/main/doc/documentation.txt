== Introduction

Nowadays, an ever increasing amount of data is to be expected and seen in science. There is a great potential to gain new insights in various scientific fields by using data efficiently. The side effect  is an ever increasing complexity and amount of the data and therefore the potential effort by scientists in their daily work increases as well. Data processing and management methods, which could efficiently be used in the past efficiently, might simply become impractical with such large amounts of data. Therefor, new methods need to be designed, developed and adopted.

The MASi (Metadata Management for Applied Sciences) DFG project is, first, advancing research data management methods by delivering tools to extend KIT Data Manager (KIT DM) repository framework to support more sophisticated metadata handling. Second, MASi is building, operating and offering a repository service based on the KIT DM. It is a generic, flexible and metadata-driven service that enables the management of scientific data with descriptive metadata as the core pillar. The development process is accompanied by applied scientists from various and heterogeneous domains. Besides supporting data handling it also enables an efficient search within the data. Central aspects are a high performance with large-scale data, the automatic extraction and annotation of metadata and the focus of active in-use research data, in contrast to the archival.




== MASi Services and Components


=== The MetaStore Service

The MetaStore service extends the core KIT DM by the following features

- Registration of XML Schema
- Validation of XML with registered XML Schema
- Storing metadata (METS format)
- Updating metadata
- Searching for metadata via the Generic Repository Client of the KIT DM or the MetaStore REST-API
- Publish a digital object and creating a PID
- Providing a REST-API for the MetaStore functionality that is fully integrated with the KIT DM REST-API link:docu[Documentation of the REST-API of the MetaStore]

The MetaStore Service is available via the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MetaStore[MetaStore] module.



=== MASi Staging Processors


==== Tika Extractor 
Extracts all metadata from each file using https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika] library. While the metadata depends on the file the linked schema allow any content inside the file elements. The extracted content metadata will be stored inside the METS file. The extractor is contained in the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MDM-MasiProcessors[MDM-MasiProcessors] module.



==== XML Extractor 
Extracts the content metadata from an XML file that might hold all metadata in XML format. The extracted content metadata will be stored inside the METS file. The extractor is contained in the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MDM-MasiProcessors[MDM-MasiProcessors] module.





==== CVMA Extractor 

The CVMA staging processor extracts XMP metadata from CVMA images. To extract the metadata an external exif-tool is used. This has to be configured accordingly to the CVMA-XMP specification. This extractor depends on a special configuration of the exiftool and generates an XML file with an XML Schema especially generated for the Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi (CVMA). The extractor is contained in the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MDM-CVMA[MDM-CVMA] module.


==== Image Resizer 

This processor allows you to provide images in different sizes available via linked views. The extractor is contained in the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MDM-MasiProcessors[MDM-MasiProcessors] module.



 
==== PID Creator 

This processor allows you to automatically register a PID for ingested data. The configuration of the service is done via 'datamanager.xml'. The extractor is contained in the https://github.com/MetadataManagement4AppliedSciences/MetaStore[MetaStore] module.


== Client Metadata Editor GUI

This https://github.com/kit-data-manager/generic-repo-client[RepoClient] (KIT DM command line client) 
plugin is a graphical user interface at the client. It enables users to manually enter metadata, 
if automatic metadata extraction is impossible. For example, this is the case when the information 
to be entered is only known by a human and not contained in the uploaded data. 
The GUI is contained in the https://github.com/kit-data-manager/generic-repo-client[RepoClient] 
sources under src/main/doc/code/DialogPlugin4Ingest.java. For further information see 
"Extend Ingest Client using Plugins" in the RepoClient documentation.



== Client Drag'n'Drop Functionality

The https://github.com/kit-data-manager/generic-repo-client[RepoClient] (KIT DM command line client) 
can be utilized in such a way that users can graphically ingest directories as digital objects 
via drag'n'drop under Windows. The client is contained in the 
https://github.com/kit-data-manager/generic-repo-client[RepoClient] itself. For further 
information see "Dragâ€™n Drop Client (Windows)" in the RepoClient documentation.
